# lol-stat-tracker
A League of Legends stat and challenges app. This is still a work in progress, and I want to work on improving the existing functionality and adding further details and functionality. 

This web-app is a personal project to learn about and gain experience in full stack web development.

The technologies used to create this application are: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Express, and the Riot Games official API.

Current Functionality:
- Users are able to create an account on the main page and use it to log in. This login data is stored in a local MySQL database.

- after logging in, users are taken to the main page where they can save or update the "summoner name" (League of Legends in-game username) associated with their account.
After a summoner name is saved they can show their last ten games, average stats for those games, and challenges they are close to completing by hitting the 
Show last 10 games button.

- after the button is pressed the user's stats appear like this:
